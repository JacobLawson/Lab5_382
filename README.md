Lab 5 - Interrupts - "Remote Control Decoding"
========

###Objectives

In this lab, use knowledge of interrupts and the Timer_A subsytem to reverse engineer a remote control.

Lab day 1: learn the timing and bit patterns for your remote control

Lab day 2: demonstrate your code can receive and decode button presses from the remote control

Lab day 3: implement etch-a-sketch or pong
